<!-- There must be at least one junit xml file found in its search paths or the
     Jenkins surefire plugin will fail. This file is left here to make the LINT
     build pass, since it does not run any unit tests.
     Unfortunately, it gets a bit more convoluted than that. The test file also
     has to have a recent last-modified time for Jenkins to accept it.
     Therefore, the build must have an execution step that "touches" this file
     each time it runs in order for this workaround to succeed. -->
