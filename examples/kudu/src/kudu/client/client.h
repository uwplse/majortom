// A KuduSession belongs to a specific KuduClient, and represents a context in
// which all read/write data access should take place. Within a session,
// multiple operations may be accumulated and batched together for better
// efficiency. Settings like timeouts, priorities, and trace IDs are also set
// per session.
//
// A KuduSession's main purpose is for grouping together multiple data-access
// operations together into batches or transactions. It is important to note
// the distinction between these two:
//
// * A batch is a set of operations which are grouped together in order to
//   amortize fixed costs such as RPC call overhead and round trip times.
//   A batch DOES NOT imply any ACID-like guarantees. Within a batch, some
//   operations may succeed while others fail, and concurrent readers may see
//   partial results. If the client crashes mid-batch, it is possible that some
//   of the operations will be made durable while others were lost.
//
// * In contrast, a transaction is a set of operations which are treated as an
//   indivisible semantic unit, per the usual definitions of database transactions
//   and isolation levels.
//
// NOTE: Kudu does not currently support transactions! They are only mentioned
// in the above documentation to clarify that batches are not transactional and
// should only be used for efficiency.
//
// KuduSession is separate from KuduTable because a given batch or transaction
// may span multiple tables. This is particularly important in the future when
// we add ACID support, but even in the context of batching, we may be able to
// coalesce writes to different tables hosted on the same server into the same
// RPC.
//
// KuduSession is separate from KuduClient because, in a multi-threaded
// application, different threads may need to concurrently execute
// transactions. Similar to a JDBC "session", transaction boundaries will be
// delineated on a per-session basis -- in between a "BeginTransaction" and
// "Commit" call on a given session, all operations will be part of the same
// transaction. Meanwhile another concurrent Session object can safely run
// non-transactional work or other transactions without interfering.
//
// Additionally, there is a guarantee that writes from different sessions do not
// get batched together into the same RPCs -- this means that latency-sensitive
// clients can run through the same KuduClient object as throughput-oriented
// clients, perhaps by setting the latency-sensitive session's timeouts low and
// priorities high. Without the separation of batches, a latency-sensitive
// single-row insert might get batched along with 10MB worth of inserts from the
// batch writer, thus delaying the response significantly.
//
// Though we currently do not have transactional support, users will be forced
// to use a KuduSession to instantiate reads as well as writes.  This will make
// it more straight-forward to add RW transactions in the future without
// significant modifications to the API.
//
// Users who are familiar with the Hibernate ORM framework should find this
// concept of a Session familiar.
