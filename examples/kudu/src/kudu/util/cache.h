// A Cache is an interface that maps keys to values.  It has internal
// synchronization and may be safely accessed concurrently from
// multiple threads.  It may automatically evict entries to make room
// for new entries.  Values have a specified charge against the cache
// capacity.  For example, a cache where the values are variable
// length strings, may use the length of the string as the charge for
// the string.
//
// This is taken from LevelDB and evolved to fit the kudu codebase.
//
// TODO: this is pretty lock-heavy. Would be good to sub out something
// a little more concurrent.
