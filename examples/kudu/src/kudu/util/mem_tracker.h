class Status;
class MemTracker;

// A MemTracker tracks memory consumption; it contains an optional limit and is
// arranged into a tree structure such that the consumption tracked by a
// MemTracker is also tracked by its ancestors.
//
// The MemTracker hierarchy is rooted in a single static MemTracker whose limit
// is set via gflag. The root MemTracker always exists, and it is the common
// ancestor to all MemTrackers. All operations that discover MemTrackers begin
// at the root and work their way down the tree, while operations that deal
// with adjusting memory consumption begin at a particular MemTracker and work
// their way up the tree to the root. The tree structure is strictly enforced:
// all MemTrackers (except the root) must have a parent, and all children
// belonging to a parent must have unique ids.
//
// When a MemTracker begins its life, it has a strong reference to its parent
// and the parent has a weak reference to it. The strong reference remains for
// the lifetime of the MemTracker, but the weak reference can be dropped via
// UnregisterFromParent(). A MemTracker in this state may continue servicing
// memory consumption operations while allowing a new MemTracker with the same
// id to be created on the old parent.
//
// By default, memory consumption is tracked via calls to Consume()/Release(), either to
// the tracker itself or to one of its descendents. Alternatively, a consumption function
// can specified, and then the function's value is used as the consumption rather than the
// tally maintained by Consume() and Release(). A tcmalloc function is used to track process
// memory consumption, since the process memory usage may be higher than the computed
// total memory (tcmalloc does not release deallocated memory immediately).
//
// GcFunctions can be attached to a MemTracker in order to free up memory if the limit is
// reached. If LimitExceeded() is called and the limit is exceeded, it will first call the
// GcFunctions to try to free memory and recheck the limit. For example, the process
// tracker has a GcFunction that releases any unused memory still held by tcmalloc, so
// this will be called before the process limit is reported as exceeded. GcFunctions are
// called in the order they are added, so expensive functions should be added last.
//
// This class is thread-safe.
//
// NOTE: this class has been partially ported over from Impala with
// several changes, and as a result the style differs somewhat from
// the Kudu style (e.g., BOOST_FOREACH is not used).
//
// Changes from Impala:
// 1) Id a string vs. a TUniqueId
// 2) There is no concept of query trackers vs. pool trackers -- trackers are instead
//    associated with objects. Parent hierarchy is preserved, with the assumption that,
//    e.g., a tablet server's memtracker will have as its children the tablets' memtrackers,
//    which in turn will have memtrackers for their caches, logs, and so forth.
//
// TODO: this classes uses a lot of statics fields and methods, which
// isn't common in Kudu. It is probably wise to later move the
// 'registry' of trackers to a separate class, but it's better to
// start using the 'class' *first* and then change this functionality,
// depending on how MemTracker ends up being used in Kudu.
