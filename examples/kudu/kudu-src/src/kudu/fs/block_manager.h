// The block interface reflects Kudu on-disk storage design principles:
// - Blocks are append only.
// - Blocks are immutable once written.
// - Blocks opened for reading are thread-safe and may be used by multiple
//   concurrent readers.
// - Blocks opened for writing are not thread-safe.

// writing thread, and data may only be appended to the block.
//
// Close() is an expensive operation, as it must flush both dirty block data
// and metadata to disk. The block manager API provides two ways to improve
// Close() performance:
// 1. FlushDataAsync() before Close(). If there's enough work to be done
//    between the two calls, there will be less outstanding I/O to wait for
//    during Close().
// 2. CloseBlocks() on a group of blocks. This at least ensures that, when
