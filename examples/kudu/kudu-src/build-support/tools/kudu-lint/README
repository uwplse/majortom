Overview
===============
kudu-lint is a Clang-based tool for looking for kudu-specific coding errors.

Currently, it only looks for cases where a function returning Status is called,
and then that Status is ignored.

Over time we can add more AST matchers for other Kudu-specific lint checks we'd
like to implement.


Requirements
===============

This has currently only been tested against clang 3.4. Clang APIs tend to change
between versions, so this is unlikely to work on earlier versions of clang.

Building
=========

Set the CLANG_ROOT environment variable to point to the path at which clang/llvm
have been installed. This is the directory which contains bin/, lib/, etc.

Run 'cmake .', followed by 'make', in this directory.

Running
=========

In the top-level kudu source directory, run:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON .
$ find src -name \*.cc | xargs -n1 -P8 ./build-support/tools/kudu-lint/kudu-lint \
    -p . -extra-arg=-I$CLANG_ROOT/lib/clang/3.4/include
