# Find the Google Mock Framework, heavily cribbed from FindGTest.cmake.
# gmock ships a copy of gtest and bundles it in its libraries, so this also
# finds the gtest headers.
#
# This module defines
# GMOCK_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find gmock include files, etc.
# GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find gtest include files
# GMock_FOUND, If false, do not try to use gmock.
# GMOCK_STATIC_LIBRARY, Location of libgmock.a
# GMOCK_SHARED_LIBRARY, Location of libttest's shared library

# also defined, but not for general use are
# GMOCK_LIBRARY, where to find the GMock library.
